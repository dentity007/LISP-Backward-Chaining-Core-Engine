;;;; Car Diagnostic Rules for Backward Chaining Expert System
;;;; Converted from forward chaining to goal-oriented reasoning with certainty factors

(in-package :expert-system)

;; Register domain contradictions so that contradictory evidence yields
;; negative certainty for rules requiring the opposite condition.
;; Examples: (lights work) vs (lights dim-or-off), (car starts) vs (car does-not-start)
(register-contradiction '(lights work) '(lights dim-or-off))
(register-contradiction '(car starts) '(car does-not-start))
