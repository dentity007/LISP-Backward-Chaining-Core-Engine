# LISP Backward Chaining Core Engine - Car Diagnostic Expert System

A sophisticated **backward chaining expert system** implemented in Common Lisp, featuring **MYCIN-style certainty factors** and **goal-driven reasoning** for automotive troubleshooting.

## 🧠 What Makes This Special

This project demonstrates advanced AI techniques using a **backward chaining inference engine** - a significant upgrade from traditional forward chaining approaches. Unlike systems that blindly apply all rules, our engine **works backwards from goals**, asking only relevant questions to prove or disprove specific diagnoses.

### **Key AI Features:**

- 🎯 **Goal-Driven Reasoning:** Only asks questions needed to prove specific hypotheses
- 📊 **MYCIN-Style Certainty Factors:** Handles uncertainty with confidence levels (-1 to +1)
- 🔗 **Backward Chaining Inference:** Efficient, targeted diagnostic reasoning
- 🤖 **Interactive Question Engine:** Dynamic question generation based on current goals
- 📈 **Confidence-Based Results:** All conclusions include reliability percentages

### **Why Backward Chaining Matters:**

| **Forward Chaining** | **Backward Chaining** |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Asks all possible questions | Asks only relevant questions |
| "What can I conclude?" | "How can I prove this goal?" |
| Data-driven reasoning | Goal-driven reasoning |
| Less efficient for diagnosis | Optimal for diagnostic systems |
| Simple but inflexible | Sophisticated and targeted |

## 🎯 Project Educational Goals

### **Primary Objectives:**

1. **Advanced AI Techniques:** Demonstrate sophisticated inference methods beyond basic rule-based systems

2. **Uncertainty Handling:** Show how expert systems deal with incomplete or uncertain information

3. **Goal-Oriented Problem Solving:** Illustrate how AI can work backwards from desired outcomes

4. **Real-World AI Application:** Build a practical diagnostic system that provides genuine value

5. **Modern Lisp Development:** Prove that Lisp remains powerful and relevant for AI applications

### **Learning Outcomes:**

By studying this project, you'll understand:

- **Backward chaining inference algorithms** and their implementation
- **Certainty factor mathematics** and uncertainty propagation  
- **Goal-driven reasoning** and hypothesis testing
- **Expert system architecture** with separation of inference and knowledge
- **Interactive AI systems** that adapt questioning based on evidence
- **Common Lisp programming** for complex AI applications
## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Backward Chaining Inference Engine**

Our system implements a **goal-driven inference engine** that works backwards from hypotheses to evidence:

```
Goal: "Does the car have a dead battery?"
↓
System asks: "Do the lights work normally?"
↓  
User answers: "No, they're dim"
↓
System proves: "Dead battery" with 85% confidence
```

| **run.lisp** | User interface | Interactive consultation, result display, demo scenarios |

## 🧮 How Certainty Factors Work

Our system uses **MYCIN-style certainty factors** to handle uncertainty:

### **Certainty Factor Scale:**
- `+1.0` = Completely certain (true)
- `+0.8` = Very likely true  
- `+0.2` = Possibly true
- `0.0` = Unknown/no evidence
- `-0.2` = Possibly false
- `-0.8` = Very likely false
- `-1.0` = Completely certain (false)

### **User Input Options:**
- `y` or `yes` → 0.8 (high confidence positive)
- `n` or `no` → -0.8 (high confidence negative)  
- `0.5` → Custom certainty level
- `u` or `unknown` → 0.0 (no evidence)

### **Certainty Combination (MYCIN Formula):**
```lisp
;; When multiple pieces of evidence support the same conclusion:
(defun combine-certainty (cf1 cf2)
  (cond 
    ((and (>= cf1 0) (>= cf2 0))
     (+ cf1 cf2 (* -1 cf1 cf2)))    ; Both positive
    ((and (< cf1 0) (< cf2 0))  
     (+ cf1 cf2 (* cf1 cf2)))       ; Both negative
    (t (/ (+ cf1 cf2)               ; Mixed evidence
          (- 1 (min (abs cf1) (abs cf2)))))))
```

## 🚗 Automotive Diagnostic Capabilities

Our expert system can diagnose **10 major car problems** with confidence levels:

============================================================
    BACKWARD CHAINING CAR DIAGNOSTIC EXPERT SYSTEM
============================================================

Welcome! I'm your AI car diagnostic assistant.
I use backward chaining inference with certainty factors
to help diagnose your car problems.

Answer with:
  • 'y' or 'yes' for definitely yes (0.8 certainty)
  • 'n' or 'no' for definitely no (-0.8 certainty)  
  • Numbers from -1 to 1 for custom certainty
  • 'u' or 'unknown' if you're not sure

Let's begin the diagnosis...

=== RUNNING DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS ===
I'll systematically check for common car problems...

Does your car start when you turn the key?
Enter certainty (-1 to 1, or y/n for 0.8/-0.8): n

Are the headlights and dashboard lights dim or completely off?
Enter certainty (-1 to 1, or y/n for 0.8/-0.8): y

============================================================
                    DIAGNOSIS RESULTS
============================================================

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
--------------------

• Dead Battery: LIKELY (85.6% confidence)
  → This problem appears to be present

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------

For Dead Battery:
  ✓ Check battery voltage and connections
  ✓ Jump start or replace battery
  ✓ Have charging system tested
  ⚠ Estimated cost: $50-$200

SESSION SUMMARY:
---------------
Questions asked: 2
Facts established: 2  
Certainty threshold: 0.20
```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Installation

### **System Requirements:**
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** (tested on macOS)
- **SBCL** (Steel Bank Common Lisp) 2.0+
- **VS Code** (optional, for enhanced development)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### **1. Install SBCL**

**macOS (Homebrew - Recommended):**
```bash
brew install sbcl
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install sbcl
```

**Windows:**  
Download from [sbcl.org](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html)

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
sbcl --version
# Should output: SBCL 2.5.9 (or later)
```

### **2. VS Code Extensions (Optional but Recommended)**

Install these extensions for enhanced Lisp development:

1. **Common Lisp** (`ailisp.commonlisp-vscode`) - Syntax highlighting and basic support
2. **Lisp** (`mattn.lisp`) - Additional syntax highlighting  
3. **Bracket Pair Colorizer** - Makes parentheses manageable

**VS Code Settings** (automatic via `.vscode/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "commonlisp.client": "sbcl",
  "commonlisp.liveMode": false,
  "lisp.trace.server": "off"
}
```

### **3. Clone and Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dentity007/LISP-Backward-Chaining-Core-Engine.git
cd LISP-Backward-Chaining-Core-Engine

# Test the installation
sbcl --eval "(format t \"SBCL is working!~%\")" --quit
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Features & Configuration

### **Certainty Threshold Adjustment**
Control how confident the system needs to be before making conclusions:

```lisp
;; Default threshold is 0.2 (20% confidence minimum)
(setf *certainty-threshold* 0.1)  ; More sensitive (accepts lower confidence)
(setf *certainty-threshold* 0.5)  ; Less sensitive (requires higher confidence)
```

### **Diagnostic Tracing**
Enable detailed inference logging to see the reasoning process:

```lisp
(enable-trace)   ; Turn on detailed logging
(main)           ; Run diagnosis with tracing
(disable-trace)  ; Turn off logging
```

### **Custom Rule Development**
Add new diagnostic rules using the `define-rule` macro:

```lisp
(define-rule my-new-problem
  '(car-problem electrical-fault)          ; Goal to prove
  '((lights flickering) (radio static))    ; Required conditions  
  0.75                                      ; Rule confidence
  "Do the lights flicker intermittently?") ; Optional question
```

### **Batch Testing**
Test multiple scenarios programmatically:

```lisp
;; Set up facts without user interaction
(clear-session)
(add-fact '(car does-not-start) 0.9)
(add-fact '(lights dim-or-off) 0.8)

;; Run diagnosis
(let ((result (prove-goal '(car-problem dead-battery))))
  (format t "Diagnosis confidence: ~,2F~%" result))
```

## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### **Backward Chaining Algorithm**

The heart of our system is the `prove-goal` function:

```lisp
(defun prove-goal (goal)
  "Attempt to prove a goal using backward chaining"
  ;; 1. Check if goal already known
  (when (fact-known-p goal)
    (return-from prove-goal (get-fact-cf goal)))
  
  ;; 2. Try to prove using rules  
  (dolist (rule *rules*)
    (when (equal (rule-goal rule) goal)
      ;; Recursively prove all conditions
      (let ((conditions-cf (prove-conditions (rule-conditions rule))))
        (when (certainty-true-p conditions-cf)
          ;; Combine evidence using MYCIN formula
          (combine-certainty existing-cf (* conditions-cf (rule-cf rule)))))))
  
  ;; 3. If no rules work, ask user
  (when (rule-question rule)
    (ask-question goal (rule-question rule))))
```

### **Rule Structure**

Rules are defined using this structure:

```lisp
(defstruct rule
  name         ; Unique identifier
  goal         ; What this rule can prove
  conditions   ; Prerequisites that must be true
  cf           ; Confidence factor (0.0 to 1.0)
  question)    ; Question to ask user if needed
```

### **Package System**

Our system uses Common Lisp packages for clean namespace management:

```lisp
(defpackage :expert-system
  (:use :common-lisp)
  (:export #:define-rule #:consult #:prove-goal #:clear-session))
```

Install these extensions for optimal Lisp development:

```vscode-extensions

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "The terminal process failed to launch: Path to shell executable '/Users/username/.roswell/bin/cl-lsp' does not exist"

**Cause:** VS Code extensions trying to use Roswell LSP server that isn't installed.

**Solution:**
```json
// In .vscode/settings.json
{
    "commonlisp.enableLSP": false,
    "alive.lsp.executable": "sbcl",
    "alive.lsp.remote": false
}
```

### Issue 2: "Couldn't start client Alive Client"

**Cause:** Alive extension configuration issues or PATH problems.

**Solutions:**
1. **Disable LSP:** Set `"commonlisp.enableLSP": false`
2. **Use Tasks:** Prefer "Start SBCL REPL" task over Alive extension
3. **Check PATH:** Ensure SBCL is in system PATH
4. **Restart VS Code:** Reload window after configuration changes

### Issue 3: File Loading Errors - "file does not exist"

**Cause:** Directory context issues when loading files with relative paths.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use absolute paths:** `(load "/full/path/to/file.lisp")`
2. **Use self-contained version:** `simple-car-expert.lisp` has no dependencies
3. **Check working directory:** `(truename ".")` shows current directory
4. **Load in correct order:** Load dependencies before dependent files

### Issue 4: Structure Redefinition Warnings

**Cause:** Loading files multiple times with conflicting definitions.

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart REPL:** `(sb-ext:exit)` and restart for clean slate
2. **Use debugger restarts:** Choose option 0 or 1 to continue
3. **Load once:** Avoid reloading files with structure definitions

### Issue 5: Undefined Function Warnings

**Cause:** Functions called before they're defined (forward references).

**Solutions:**
1. **Ignore style warnings:** System usually works despite warnings
2. **Proper ordering:** Define functions before calling them
3. **Use self-contained version:** `simple-car-expert.lisp` has correct ordering

### Issue 6: Path Issues with Modular System

**Cause:** `car-rules.lisp` tries to load `expert-system.lisp` with relative paths.

**Solution:** Use the working files:
```lisp
# Instead of loading the modular system, use:
(load "simple-car-expert.lisp")  # Self-contained, no path issues

# Or load in correct order:
(load "car-expert-system/expert-system.lisp")
(load "car-expert-system/car-rules.lisp")
```

## 🎯 Best Practices & Recommendations

### For Development

1. **Use Self-Contained Files:** Avoid complex file dependencies during development
2. **Start Fresh:** Restart REPL when encountering structure conflicts
3. **Test Incrementally:** Load and test small pieces before building larger systems
4. **Use VS Code Tasks:** More reliable than extension-based REPL for beginners

### For Production

1. **Organize by Modules:** Separate concerns (engine, rules, interface)
2. **Handle Path Issues:** Use proper file loading strategies
3. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for file operations
4. **Documentation:** Document file dependencies and load order

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with simple-car-expert.lisp** to understand the system
2. **Experiment with individual components** once familiar
3. **Build modular systems** after mastering basics
4. **Use version control** to track working configurations
